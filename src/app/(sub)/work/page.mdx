# Open to Work

I am currently considering new opportunities, in a product engineering role or similar. Remote is preferred, hybrid possible within the Netherlands.

Short profile:

- I enjoy talking to users and solving their problems, thinking about everything from design to infrastructure.
- Almost 5 years of experience in software engineering, in full-stack roles.
- 1.5 years developing and now running my own SaaS.
- University educated, but give as much weight to my Rubik's cube PB.

Just reach out via [e-mail](mailto:info@simonvreman.nl) and we can have a chat!
